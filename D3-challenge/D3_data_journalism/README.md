# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3
## Date: Agosto 2020
### By Raúl Flores Palacios

## INTRODUCTION 
You’ve just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You’re tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people’s lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She’s counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.


## Level 1: Core Assignment (Required)

* Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.
* Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You’ll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directory—make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.
* Include state abbreviations in the circles.
* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
* Note: You’ll need to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.

## Conclusions

#### Based on the Census data analysis, we identify a strong correlation between "Age" and the number of "Smokers" around the country's states. This correlation is high between the ages of 34 and 44, where we observe the highest smokers' rates.

#### As we can observe in the chart, Utah has the lowest cigarette smoking rates in the country. Utah Tobacco Prevention & Control Programs reduce healthcare costs.

#### Based on the circle's size, we can also observe the healthcare costs around the country, noticing that Texas has the highest healthcare costs around the states.

#### Tobacco prevention and control activities are public health "best buy." Evidence-based, statewide tobacco control programs that are comprehensive, sustained, and accountable have been shown to reduce the number of people who smoke and tobacco-related diseases and deaths. For every dollar spent on tobacco prevention, states can reduce tobacco-related healthcare expenditures and hospitalizations by up to $55. The more extended and more governments invest, the larger the reductions in youth and adult smoking. 

#### On the other way around, Texas is the state with the highest healthcare cost in the entire country. But it is not related to smoking behaviors, since the smoker's index is not so high vs. other states in the USA.
