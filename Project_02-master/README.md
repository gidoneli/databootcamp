# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## INTRODUCTION 
We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There’s a catch though… we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.


## Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)
* Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).
* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
* Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.
* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

The final webpage look is illustrated here:

## Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional) - BONUS
Complete all of Level 1 criteria. Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
* date/time
* city
* state
* country
* shape
